                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> My name is Sasha, and I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in biological
                    sciences at the University of Missouri with an expected graduate date of Spring 2024.
                    Although I primarily grew up in Chicago, my childhood consisted of adventures exploring the diverse landscapes 
                    and ecosystems across the United States. These formative experiences have shaped my passion for biology and its 
                    real-world applications. Whether analyzing the intricacies of cellular biology or the mechanisms of disease 
                    transmission, I am fascinated by the complexities of the natural world. Through my experiences in 
                    collaboration, outreach programs, research projects, and hands-on experience I have cultivated an area 
                    of interest: immunology. As I navigate my journey of being a lifelong learner, I seek out new 
                    opportunities to broaden my understanding of immunology, its role in society, and the advancement of human 
                    health. Hence, I am committed to fostering a comprehensive understanding of foundational biological principles
                    while encouraging prospective students to explore their unique areas of scientific exploration.</p>
        
                <h2>Education Overview</h2>
                <p> Through a biological sciences degree, there is an emphasis on biological processes through both <i>wet</i> and
                    <i>dry</i> labs. In coordination with biology degree requirements, I have taken diversity courses in
                    medical microbiology and immunology through The University of Missouri School of Medicine.
                    This has greatly expanded my understanding of scientific processes and reinforces the
                    interdisciplinary nature of biology. In addition to formal education through the Arts & Science
                    College, I have professional experience in patient care positions where laboratory techniques,
                    phlebotomy training, and medical terminology were acquired. Experience in a healthcare setting
                    has contributed to my exceeding interest in biological principles that drive medical innovations
                    and disease research. Furthermore, education and experience are a <b>continuing</b> process that I hope
                    to pursue through a Master of Medical Sciences in Immunology.</p><br>
