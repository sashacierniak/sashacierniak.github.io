   <h1>Educator Credential </h1>
   <h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>My name is Sasha, and I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in biological
sciences at the University of Missouri with an expected graduate date of Spring 2024. Through a
biological sciences degree, there is an emphasis on biological processes through both <i>wet</i> and
<i>dry</i> labs. In coordination with biology degree requirements, I have taken diversity courses in
medical microbiology and immunology through The University of Missouri School of Medicine.
This has greatly expanded my understanding of scientific processes and reinforces the
interdisciplinary nature of biology. In addition to formal education through the Arts & Science
College, I have professional experience in patient care positions where laboratory techniques,
phlebotomy training, and medical terminology were acquired. Experience in a healthcare setting
has contributed to my exceeding interest in biological principles that drive medical innovations
and disease research. Furthermore, education and experience are a <b>continuing</b> process that I hope
to pursue through a Master of Medical Sciences in Immunology.</p>
