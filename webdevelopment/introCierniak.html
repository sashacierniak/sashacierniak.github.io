    My name is Sasha Cierniak and I am pursuing a degree in biological sciences at the University of Missouri. While I primarily grew up in the Chicago suburbs, I spent much of my childhood moving around the United States. In high school I took an introductory webpage design class; however, this course is my first formal exposure to web application and development training. Despite not having previous experience with the course material, I expect to develop a website and gain proficiency in HTML and CSS. I intend on furthering my development training and venturing into alternative programming languages which I hope to apply to professional opportunities. When I am not in school, I spend my time with family and friends! One of my favorite hobbies is figure skating. My parents were competitive figure skaters and performers, so skating has always been an interest of mine. Thus, if I had to imagine my perfect day it would be spent figure skating, going to local restaurants, window shopping, and seeing a movie!
