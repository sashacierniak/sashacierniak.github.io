            <h2>Immune System Components and Function</h2>
            <p>
                The immune system is a dynamic and complex network of cells, organs, and tissues that are
                responsible for protecting your body against harmful organisms by antigen identification, effect
                mitigation, combating disease-causing mutations, establishing prevention barriers, and healing
                damaged cells and tissues. An immune response is elicited when a suspected “invader” surpasses
                these preestablished physical or chemical barriers such as the skin and mucosa respectively
                (Professional, n.d.). These “invaders” are called pathogens and can take the form of bacteria,
                fungi, parasites, viruses, and cancer cells. The immune system is divided into two parts: the
                innate and adaptive immune system. Together these systems coordinate to enact the first line
                defense to invaders and develop specific immunity over time. 
            </p>

        <div class="bottom-row">
            <h2>Innate Immune System </h2>
            <p>Both the innate and adaptive immune system have cells that they recruit to the active site of an
                infection or suspected pathogen. However, the innate immune system is best suited for rapid,
                generalized responses that are seen through physical barriers, cellular components, and humoral
                responses. The innate immune response is associated with the first-line defense, which is
                activated with intrinsic mechanisms programmed within the body (WHAT IS INNATE
                IMMUNITY? | Center for Innate Immunity and Immune Disease, n.d.). Cellular components
                include phagocytes that enable digestion, natural killer (NK) cells that specialize in targeting
                pathogens and the complement system that enhances and directs immune responses by increasing
                inflammation and directing immune responses (Newman, 2023). The innate immune not only
                provides immediate protection but is integral in shaping subsequent adaptive immune responses. </p>
