            <h2>Immune System Components and Function</h2>
            <p>
                The immune system is a dynamic and complex network of cells, organs, and tissues that are
                responsible for protecting your body against harmful organisms by antigen identification, effect
                mitigation, combating disease-causing mutations, establishing prevention barriers, and healing
                damaged cells and tissues. An immune response is elicited when a suspected “invader” surpasses
                these preestablished physical or chemical barriers such as the skin and mucosa respectively
                (Professional, n.d.). These “invaders” are called pathogens and can take the form of bacteria,
                fungi, parasites, viruses, and cancer cells. The immune system is divided into two parts: the
                innate and adaptive immune system. Together these systems coordinate to enact the first line
                defense to invaders and develop specific immunity over time. </p>

        <div class="seg1">
            <h2>Innate Immune System</h2>
            <p>Both the innate and adaptive immune system have cells that they recruit to the active site of an
                infection or suspected pathogen. However, the innate immune system is best suited for rapid,
                generalized responses that are seen through physical barriers, cellular components, and humoral
                responses. The innate immune response is associated with the first-line defense, which is
                activated with intrinsic mechanisms programmed within the body (WHAT IS INNATE
                IMMUNITY? | Center for Innate Immunity and Immune Disease, n.d.). Cellular components
                include phagocytes that enable digestion, natural killer (NK) cells that specialize in targeting
                pathogens and the complement system that enhances and directs immune responses by increasing
                inflammation and directing immune responses (Newman, 2023). The innate immune not only
                provides immediate protection but is integral in shaping subsequent adaptive immune responses. </p>

        <div class="seg1">
            <h2>Adaptive Immune System</h2>
            <p>The adaptive immune system is defined by its ability to perform antigen-specific immune
                responses. Unlike the innate response, the adaptive immune system can recognize, remember,
                and offer defense to pathogens upon reinfection. Its immunological memory provides longlasting protection against harmful pathogens, further establishing its importance. The primary
                cells that facilitate its immune response are lymphocytic B and T cells. B cells are specialized for
                antibody production while T cells have a diverse set of functions such as direct attacks, immune
                response coordination, and regulation activity. (Alberts, 2002). The specification of the adaptive
                immune system is a crucial component in the body’s immunological defense. </p>

        <div class="seg1">
            <h2>Disorders of the Immune System</h2>
            <p>The immune system utilizes a multisystem approach to ensure that harmful pathogens that enter
                the body are unable to infiltrate biological processes. However, in instances where the immune
                system is unable to facilitate proper coordination, there is an increased susceptibility to
                immunodeficiency disorders, autoimmune disorders, allergies, and the emergence of cancerous
                cells. Malfunctions can arise due to genetic factors, medical conditions, and environmental
                effects (Disorders of the Immune System, 2023). Depending on the disorder, the effects can
                range from mild inconvenience to deleterious dysfunction of essential immune cells. By looking
                at varying disorders and deficiencies such as HIV/AIDS, Lupus, and Eczema, their underlying
                immune response and dysfunction can be analyzed. </p>
